##LP is amazing##

There are times when every piece of music I try listening to sucks. That one song on which I can always fall back on, also ditches me. This is when I came across LP. 
It was instant love. The ease with which LP sings, is soothing for some reason. The music flows through her. You can see the music becoming a part of her. This 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2UExUhq-s&list=RDfâ‰ˆD2UExUhq-s&start_radio=1"> video</a> is inspirational and calming at the same time. It makes me want to 
do something, anything such that when I do it, I become a part of it. When I do "that" thing, I enjoy it, which makes others enjoy it. There are random things which catch my eye. This 
video sure is one of them.
